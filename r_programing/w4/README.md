## Week 4 

Simulation and Profiling

---

This week covers how to simulate data in R, which serves as the basis for doing simulation studies. 
We also cover the profiler in R which lets you collect detailed information on how your R functions are running 
and to identify bottlenecks that can be addressed. The profiler is a key tool in helping you optimize your programs. 
Finally, we cover the str function, which I personally believe is the most useful function in R.
