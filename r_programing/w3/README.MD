## Week 3 

Loop Functions and Debugging

---

This week is what I call "loop functions" in R, which are functions that allow you to execute loop-like behavior in a compact 
form. These functions typically have the word "apply" in them and are particularly convenient when you need to execute a loop 
on the command line when using R interactively. These functions are some of the more interesting functions of the R language. 
This week we also cover the debugger that comes with R and how to interpret its output to help you find problems in your 
programs and functions.
